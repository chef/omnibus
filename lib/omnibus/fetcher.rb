  #   it's supposed to be abstract
  class Fetcher
    # Given an error and a fetcher that generated the error, print a
    # formatted report of the error and stacktrace, along with fetcher
    # details to stderr.
    #
    # @note Does not rethrow the error; that must currently be done manually.
    #
    # @todo Since this is always called from within a fetcher, and
    #   since the fetcher always passes itself in in the {#initialize}
    #   method, this really ought to be encapsulated in a method call on
    #   {Omnibus::Fetcher}.
    # @todo Also, since we always 'raise' after calling {#explain}, we
    #   should just go ahead and exit from here.  No need to raise,
    #   since we're already outputting the real error and stacktrace
    #   here.
