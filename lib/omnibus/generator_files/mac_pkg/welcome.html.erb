This is a basic welcome message that is generated for every Omnibus project. You should customize this message by editing the file at files/mac_pkg/welcome.html.

If you are not the developer of <%= config[:name] %>, the presence of this message is likely a bug and should be reported to the creator.

Thank you for choosing Omnibus! Have a fantastic day!
