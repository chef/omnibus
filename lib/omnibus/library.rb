    # The order in which each Software component should be built. The order is
    # based on the order of #components, optimized to move top-level
    # dependencies later in the build order to make the git caching feature
    # more effective. It is assumed that #components is already sorted in a
    # valid dependency order. The optimization works as follows:
    #
    # 1. The first component is assumed to be a preparation step that needs to
    # run first, so it is not moved.
    # 2. If a component is a top-level dependency of the project AND no other
    # software depends on it, it is shifted to last in the optimized order.
    # 3. If none of the above conditions are met, the order of that component
    # is unchanged.
