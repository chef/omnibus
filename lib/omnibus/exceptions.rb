One or more required S3 configuration values is missing.

Your effective configuration was the following:

    s3_bucket     #{@s3_bucket.inspect}
    s3_access_key #{@s3_access_key.inspect}
    s3_secret_key #{@s3_secret_key.inspect}

If you truly do want S3 caching, you should add values similar to the following
in your Omnibus config file:

    s3_bucket     ENV['S3_BUCKET_NAME']
    s3_access_key ENV['S3_ACCESS_KEY']
    s3_secret_key ENV['S3_SECRET_KEY']

Note that you are not required to use environment variables as illustrated (and
the ones listed have no special significance in Omnibus), but it is encouraged
to prevent spread of sensitive information and inadvertent check-in of same to
version control systems.

  class BadReplacesLine < Error
    def to_s
      <<-EOH
The `replaces` project DSL statement should never equal the `package_name` or
`name` of a project. The `replaces` option should only be used when you have
published an artifact under one name and then later renamed the packages that
you are publishing and you must obsolete the old package name. For example this
is used, correctly, in chef-client builds:

    name 'chef'
    replaces 'chef-full'

The RPMs and debs which were originally published were named "chef-full" and
this was later renamed, and in order to upgrade the (very old) "chef-full"
packages the new "chef" packages needed to know to uninstall any "chef-full"
packages that were found. Projects which have never been renamed, however,
should never use the replaces line.
