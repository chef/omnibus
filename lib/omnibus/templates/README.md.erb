# <%= config[:name] %> Omnibus project

This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for
`<%= config[:name] %>`!

## Installation

We'll assume you have Ruby 1.9+ and Bundler installed. First ensure all
required gems are installed and ready to use:

```shell
$ bundle install --binstubs
```

## Usage

### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus build project <%= config[:name] %>
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform
where the `build project` command is invoked. So running this command on say a
MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X specific package. After the build
completes packages will be available in `pkg/`.

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with
the `clean` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes __ALL__ files generated during the
build including the project install directory (`/opt/<%= config[:name] %>`) and
the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ bin/omnibus clean --purge
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the
`help` command:

```shell
$ bin/omnibus help
```
