          # Alright kids, sit down while grandpa tells you a story. Back when the
          # Internet was just a series of tubes, and you had to "dial in" using
          # this thing called a "modem", ancient astronaunt theorists (computer
          # scientists) invented gzip to compress requests sent over said tubes
          # and make the Internet faster.
          #
          # Fast forward to the year of broadband - ungzipping these files was
          # tedious and hard, so Ruby and other client libraries decided to do it
          # for you:
          #
          #   https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/c49ae7/lib/net/http.rb#L1031-L1033
          #
          # Meanwhile, software manufacturers began automatically compressing
          # their software for distribution as a +.tar.gz+, publishing the
          # appropriate checksums accordingly.
          #
          # But consider... If a software manufacturer is publishing the checksum
          # for a gzipped tarball, and the client is automatically ungzipping its
          # responses, then checksums can (read: should) never match! Herein lies
          # the bug that took many hours away from the lives of a once-happy
          # developer.
          #
          # TL;DR - Do not let Ruby ungzip our file
          #
