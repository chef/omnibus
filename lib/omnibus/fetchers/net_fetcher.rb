        # Alright kids, sit down while grandpa tells you a story. Back when the
        # Internet was just a series of tubes, and you had to "dial in" using
        # this thing called a "modem", ancient astronaunt theorists (computer
        # scientists) invented gzip to compress requests sent over said tubes
        # and make the Internet faster.
        #
        # Fast forward to the year of broadband - ungzipping these files was
        # tedious and hard, so Ruby and other client libraries decided to do it
        # for you:
        #
        #   https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/c49ae7/lib/net/http.rb#L1031-L1033
        #
        # Meanwhile, software manufacturers began automatically compressing
        # their software for distribution as a +.tar.gz+, publishing the
        # appropriate checksums accordingly.
        #
        # But consider... If a software manufacturer is publishing the checksum
        # for a gzipped tarball, and the client is automatically ungzipping its
        # responses, then checksums can (read: should) never match! Herein lies
        # the bug that took many hours away from the lives of a once-happy
        # developer.
        #
        # TL;DR - Do not let Ruby ungzip our file
        #
        h['Accept-Encoding'] = 'identity'

        # Set the cookie if one was given
