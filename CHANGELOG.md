Omnibus Ruby CHANGELOG
======================

Unreleased
----------
- Update project generators to use new APIs. The old project generators created a project that issued deprecation warnings!
- Stream build output to the debug logger. Specifying `--log-level debug` now includes **all** the build output as if you had run the command manually.
- Deprecate the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` environment variable in favor of the command line flag. This is only a deprecation, but the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` will be removed in the next major release.
- Fix a bug in `windows_safe_path` to always return a string
- Add a `Config.base_dir` configuration value for easy tuning
- Remove the use of `Omnibus.root` in `BuildVersion#initializer`. This removes the many deprecation warnings that print on each software load.


v3.1.0 (May 14, 2014)
-------------------------
### New Features
- `friendly_name` is added to project DSL to be able to configure the name on packagers.
- `resources_path` is added to project DSL to be able to specify project specific resource files for packagers.
- Add the ability to "sign" OSX packages
- Allow packagers to have project-specific resources
- MSI packager for windows
- Added helpers for generating platform-specific paths
- New build_version DSL
- All new CLI that uses LazyLoading and a much nicer interface (BC-compat)
- Create a real logger object - Omnibus now supports --log-level
- Warn when incorrectly using `replaces` in a project

### Bug fixes
- Fix Windows bugs in the new git caching feature
- Use the git sha in the git caching so that the software matches "master"
- Force the detaching of all disks before building an OSX DMG
- Remove references to now non-existent Vagrantfile
- Fix an issue where softwares that are both top-level and transitive dependencies were built in the wrong order (see #140 for more information)
- Use `source` when creating software uris and checksums
- Fix invalid cache operations by ensuring the bucket exists
- Add tag output git describe to include lightweight tags
- Remove explicit instance_eval from line 0
- Remove libz and libgcc_s from the health check whitelist

### Miscellaneous Changes

- Bump the version of the generated Gemfile to Berkshelf ~> 3.0
- Add test coverage for overridding software source
- Improved test coverage for Omnibus project/software loading
- Refactor and updated Thor

- Lazy load Ohai and Mixlib::Config default values
- Consistent deprecation warnings
- Updated README badges


v3.0.0 (March 27, 2014)
------------
### New Features

- **No more rake!** Software definitions are incrementally built and cached using git instead. Software dependency build has been rewritten to leverage git caching. This means compiled software definitions are cached, so future Omnibus project builds are much faster. However, this does introduce some potential breaking changes.

  - Project-level software dependencies are built **last**.
  - it is assumed that project-level software dependencies are most frequently changed, and thus Omnibus optimize for such a case.
  - If you have software definitions that hard code `always_build`, you will probably want to turn that off now.
  - Blank directories are not cached. If you would like a blank directory to be cached, add a `.gitkeep` file to the folder.
  - The build order is compiled in a different way, which might result in a different ordered-installation than previous versions of omnibus.
  - For an example of you you might need to update your project, please see [opscode/omnibus-software@02d06a](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/commit/02d06a74c02340b592e1864e7ab843bc14fa352a)

- Support for building DMGs (OSX Disk Images)
- Update generator to create assets for pkg/dmg resources
- There's a fancy new logo
- Added Chef Sugar integration
- Improved documentation
- Improved test coverage

### Bug fixes

- Project generators now include apt/yum as development cookbooks
- Added libc++.1.dylib as a whitelist healthcheck
- Added libgcc_s.so,1 as a whitelist healthcheck on Solaris
- Fix a bug where `extra_package_files` would break FPM

v2.0.1 (March 18, 2014)
-----------------------
- Fix the name of the `pkg` artifact created on OSX
- Fix new Rubocop warnings
- Update generated `Gemfile` to use Omnibus 2.0
