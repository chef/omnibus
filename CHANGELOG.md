Omnibus CHANGELOG
=================
v4.1.0 (September 1, 2015)
-------------------------
### New Features
- Allow semver prefixes that start with "v"
- Reset target_shasum in PathFetcher after every fetch, preventing erroneous GitCache misses for builds that produced local artifacts during the previous omnibus run.
- Allow users to specify options to the underlying FileSyncer in a Software definition
- Add CPPFLAGS in with_standard_compiler_flags
- Add a Fedora dist tag to package name and spec release
- Copy distribution.xml.erb also when creating project with --pkg-assets
- Manage version manifests with Omnibus. Omnibus now creates a version manifest in text and JSON.
- Retry failed downloads
- Support inclusion of email address in Wix template
- Allow solaris to use mapfiles
- A new `omnibus generate changelog` command generates an opinionated CHANGELOG entry based on metadata in commit messages.
- Add warnings on empty globs.
- Raspberry Pi 2 support
- Clone git repositories with --recursive flag
- Add ability to sign MSIs
- Support running Omnibus with 64-bit ruby on Windows
- Create an Artifactory build for published packages
- Add a "windows_arch" omnibus option to choose 32/64 bit builds.
- Set directory ownership/permissions to match the filesystem package.
- Allow Windows 10 builders
- Allow omnibus to build "bundled" Windows installers
- Set perms on control files per Ubuntu Software Center's lintian checks.
- Replace uber-s3 dependency with aws-sdk

### Bug Fixes
- Config.append_timestamp is now properly handled by the build_version
  DSL.  For some users, this may introduce a change in behavior.  To
  revert to the old behavior set append_timestamp to false in
  `omnibus.rb` or use --override append_timestamp:false at the command
  line.
- Do not memoize current_revision to avoid returning incorrect data. Memoizing current_revision was previously causing version_for_cache to return the pre-fetch revision of the software, leading us to erroneously restore an older revision from the cache.
- Clean up "files listed twice" warnings. This should allow signing RPMs on EL 7
- dpkg uses arch name ppc64el (instead of ppc64le) for little endian
- Override equality operator for ManifestEntry. Prior to this, we simply tested basic object identity, which would result in many "updated" dependencies
- Correctly determine git repository when running in a subdirectory
- Forcibly remove a non-empty project dir before cloning because if multiple projects are using the same maching for building, they might have two different software definitions that share the same name but a different source.
- Accomidate hardlinks properly
- When building spec file, handle path names that contain spaces
- Add libkvm and libprocstat to freebsd whitelist
- Properly render ERB templates that do not have variables
- Change git fetcher to correctly fetch when repo name is the same but branch/version is different.

### Potentially Breaking Changes
- `Omnibus::SemanticVersion.new` now raises `Omnibus::InvalidVersion` instead of `Omnibus::SemanticVersion::InvalidVersion`
- Cache Builder#shasum before Builder#build to ensure consistent result.
- Update chef-sugar to 3.0 which adds ppc64le support.
- The MSI packager now adds the architecture to the msi name. The file names go from `package_name-build_version-build_iteration` to `package_name-build_version-build_iteration-arch`.

v4.0.0 (December 15, 2014)
--------------------------
### New Features
- Implement packager-specific DSLs. Packagers now define their own custom methods that may be configured using the `package` block in a project file. For more information, please see the README or any of the embedded "Building on X" documents.
- Use vendored assets. In previous versions of Omnibus, the generator would create resource assets for DMG, PKG, and MSI packages, regardless of whether you intended to build those packages. This could cause repo bloat and information overload. In Omnibus 4, the default generator does not create these assets, and instead prefers "general" vendored assets. If you are planning to make a resource-intensive package (such as a PKG or MSI), it is encouraged you generate these assets by specifing the `--pkg-assets` flag during project generation. Omnibus will prefer local resources in the `resources/` directory and then fall-back to "sane" defaults which are vendored within Omnibus.
- Refactored packagers and remove FPM. Omnibus now builds all packages using Ruby and system tooling. This provides a speed improvement and added control over the way packages are built, while simplifying the DSL.
- Refactored fetcher objects that include performance enhancements and better cachability across platforms.
- Added `Omnibus.which` to search `ENV['PATH']` for the given executable. This is used internally in Omnibus but is also available inside software definitions.
- Lazy load project and software definitions. In previous versions of Omnibus, Omnibus would load **all** software files found on disk. Omnibus 4 will selectively load softwares from the most preferred location.
- Expand project and software searching. Omnibus 4 now allows a user to specify a list of local software repos and software gems. Omnibus 4 will search the local repository (config/software), then any local file system specified software repos, then any loaded gems. These search paths and gems can be specified in the Omnibus config.
- Extracted template rendering into a helper module. Omnibus now renders templates from this single method, so you always have the same ERB expectations.
- Added many new DSL methods for packagers, builders, project, and software. Please see the **DSL Changes** below for detailed information.
- Extracted FileSyncer into a top-level class with added test coverage.
- Builder DSL method `erb` will search all configured software repos for the template, following the previously described specificity search.
- Builder DSL method `patch` will search all configured software repos for the patch file, following the previously described specificity search.
- Standardize on a single way for loading projects from disk - `Project.load`. This method is part of the public API and can be used with Omnibus as a library for loading a project from preferred paths on disk.
- Standardize on a single way for loading software from disk - `Software.load`. This method is part of the public API and can be used with Omnibus as a library for loading a software from preferred paths on disk.
- Added all-new compressor scaffolding and skeleton. Previously, a DMG was considered a "packager", but it is actually a compressor. You can read more about the compressor syntax in the Omnibus 4 release notes or the Omnibus README.
- Added a TGZ compressor for post-processing larger packagers into tarballs.
- Use Ruby's native `open-uri` in the NetFetcher. This permits users to specify http, https, or ftp URLs.
- Include hidden files and folders when calculating a directory digest.
- Use the relative path of a file when calculating a directory digest.
- Create required directories "as-needed" rather than at the start of a run. This prevents Omnibus from creating a ton of random directories on disk before the build even begins.
- Use an Ruby implmentation that behaves like rsync for PathFetcher objects. This removes the implicit dependency on rsync/rubocopy on build systems.
- Add support for Ubuntu 14.04 in the build lab
- Centralize the algorithm for determining the packager for the current system.
- Enhance the `Util` module to include FileSystem methods like `create_directory`.
- Always build packages in a temporary, staging directory and then copy the generated asset(s) back into `Config.package_dir`.
- Add sanity checking around package name generation (e.g. removing specical characters) and issue a warning when package names might contain invalid characters.
- Rewrite AIX BFF packager from scratch.
- Rewrite Debian/Ubuntu DEB packager from scratch using `dpkg-deb`.
- Rewrite Other Makeself packager from scratch using more in-memory operations (instead of filesystem).
- Rewrite Windows MSI packager from scratch and use more flexible default XML templates.
- Support installing an MSI package into more than one directory deep (e.g. C:\Program Files\Chef Software\Chef).
- Rewrite OS X PKG packager from scratch with templates instead of heredocs for XML/PLists.
- Rewrite RedHat/CentOS RPM packager from scratch to use custom spec files and `rpmbuild`.
- Rewrite Solaris Solaris packager. This packager is still in need of a major overhaul.
- Allow DSL authors to specify a URL may be downloaded using `:unsafe` redirects from HTTPS -> HTTP.
- Added a real functional test suite that runs on Travis CI for the Build DSL
- Improved test coverage by 280%.
- Treat all files as binary. This solves a number of strange encoding issues you may have been experiencing.
- Prevent Ruby from automatically ungzipping responses.
- Added `Config.workers` key for specifying the maximum number of parallel events to take place.
- Added parallel downloads for fetcher objects.
- Use `fakeroot` for building DEBs and RPMs.
- Raspberry Pi platform support (Raspian, Pidora).
- Retry uploads to Artifactory on publish failures.

### Potentially Breaking Changes
- Remove embedded functional tests. Because the functional tests were skipped on CI (and require a system of each type to properly execute), they have been removed. Chef has created the [omnibus-harmony](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-harmony) pipeline to perform true integration testing using the in-house CI cluster. If you were relying on the integration tests (or the associated Rake tasks), they have been removed.
- Move vendored `makeself` and `makeself-header` script from `bin/` to `resources/` folder. Having the `makeself` script inside `bin/` would cause `makeself` to be bundled with the gem and added to `$PATH`. If you were previously relying on Omnibus adding `makeself` to your `$PATH`, this will no longer happen.
- Cleanroom now subclasses `Object` instead of `Omnibus`. This could have unintended side-effects if you were accessing Omnibus internals (like `Config`) inside software or project DSL methods. You must now specify the entire namespace (e.g. `Omnibus::Config`).
- Builder filesystem DSL methods change directory into `Software#project_dir` before executing.
- Builder filesystem DSL methods now accept paths or globs.
- Packagers attempt to ignore SCM-based files during packaging.
- Move internal cleanroom implementation into a [cleanroom standalone-gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/cleanroom). If you were relying or invoking `Omnibus::Cleanroom`, please see the gem documentation.
- `Omnibus.process_configuration` has been removed. This method was actually a noop and entirely unused. If you are using Omnibus as a library, this method does not need to be invoked and the call can safely be removed.
- Remove `Config.fetch` and `Config[:key]`. You should use `Config.thing` instead.
- Standardize errors on `MissingRequiredAttribute`. In previous versions of Omnibus, you would get a different error depending on _where_ a required attribute was missing. In Config, Omnibus would raise `MissingConfigOption`, in project, Omnibus would raise `MissingProjectConfiguration` and in software, Omnibus would raise `MissingSoftwareConfiguration`. All these error classes have been removed and standardized on `MissingRequiredAttribute`.
- Remove many unused error classes.
- Remove all implementations of ErrorReporter classes. These classes attempted to read the output of a stacktrace and intelligently display information to the user about the failure. However, these classes proved to hide errors or provide false information more than they were helpful.
- Raise `NotImplementedError` (Ruby core) instead of `AbstractMethod` or `AbstractFunction` (Omnibus) errors when a method should be overridden by the child class.
- Refactor `GitFetcher`, removing retries and complex error handling. If a git command fails, you will see the error from git instead of an Omnibus-translated error.
- Raise a `ChecksumMismatch` exception when a provided md5 does not match the downloaded one.
- When extracting tar archives, prefer gtar over tar when gtar is present.
- Move `Omnibus::Packager::Metadata` to `Omnibus::Metadata` and improve documentation
- Change the airty of `Omnibus::Metadata.generate` to accept [1] the path to the package on disk and [2] the project which created the package.
- Selectively load Ohai plugins. Please note: the Ohai that is loaded with Omnibus includes very minimal system information compared to the Ohai that comes with Chef. If you are expecting the data to be the same, you have been warned!
- Remove all uses of forwardable delegation.
- Cache the loading of projects
- Cache the loading of software
- When accessing DSL methods for the first time, do not persist the default value onto the instance variable.
- Bump the required version of Chef Sugar to `~> 2.2` to pick up new `smartos?` and `omnios?` matchers.
- Removed vendor spec fixture data. I do not know why you would be using it, but if you were relying on any of that data, it is now gone and fixtures are constructed manually at test time.
- Renamed `Package::MacPkg` to `Packager::PKG`
- Renamed `Package::MacDmg` to `Compressor::DMG`
- Truncate SLES and other RedHat derivatives platform version.
- Refactor logger objects to separate Omnibus internal debugging info with build/compile/configure debugging info.
- Improve error and debugging output when an exception is raised while shelling out. Failed shell commands will now raise `Omnibus::CommandFailed` and `Omnibus::CommandTimeout` instead of the `Mixlib::ShellOut` exceptions. If you were previously rescuing the Mixlib exceptions, you should switch to the new ones.
- XL C is now the default compiler on AIX
- Clang is now the default compiler on FreeBSD 10+
- Make compilation default `-static-libgcc` on Solaris
- Only allow installation on system volume for Mac OS X PKGs.

### Definitely Breaking Changes
- Previously deprecated methods have been removed.
- `Config#package_tmp` is no longer used. `Dir.mktmpdir` is used to generate an operating-system agnostic temporary directory for packagers to operate in.
- `Config#build_dmg` is no longer used. If you wish to build a dmg, you must specify a `compressor` block with the `:dmg` option.
- `Config#dmg_window_bounds` is no longer used. If you wish to specify dmg window bounds, you must specify a `compressor` block with the `:dmg` option and specify the `window_bounds` attribute.
- `Config#dmg_pkg_position` is no longer used. If you wish to specify dmg package positioning, you must specify a `compressor` block with the `:dmg` option and specify the `pkg_position` attribute.
- `Config#sign_pkg` is no longer used. If you specify a signing identity, it is assumed you want to sign the package.
- `Config#signing_identity` is no longer used. If you wish to specify package signing identity, you must specify a `package` block with the `:pkg` option and specify the `signing_identity` attribute.
- `Config#sign_rpm` is no longer used. If you specify an rpm signing passphrase, it is assumed you want to sign the package.
- `Config#rpm_signing_passphrase` is no longer used. If you wish to specify package signing identity, you must specify a `package` block with the `:rpm` option and specify the `signing_passphrase` attribute.
- `Project#msi_parameters` has been removed. If you wish to specify msi parameters, you must specify a `package` block with the `:msi` option and specify the `parameters` attribute.
- **`Project#msi_parameters[:upgrade_code]` is no longer used!** You must specify an `upgrade_code` in a `package` block with the `:msi` option.
- Remove all instances of `NullBuilder`. If you were previously invoking a `NullBuilder`, simply omit a `build` block.
- Remove packager `validate` pre-step
- Remove packager `cleanup` post-step
- **Changed the method arity of `Software#initialize` - this method no longer accepts a list of overrides.**
- `Builder#max_build_jobs` has been renamed to `Builder#workers`.

### Deprecations
- `Config#package_tmp` prints a deprecation. There is no replacement for this method.
- `Config#build_dmg` prints a deprecation. You should specify a `compressor` block with the `:dmg` option instead.
- `Config#dmg_window_bounds` prints a deprecation. You should specify the `window_bounds` inside `compressor :dmg` instead.
- `Config#dmg_pkg_position` prints a deprecation. You should specify the `pkg_position` inside `compressor :dmg` instead.
- `Config#sign_pkg` prints a deprecation. If you specify a signing identity, it is assumed you want to sign the package.
- `Config#signing_identity` prints a deprecation. You should specify the `signing_identity` inside `package :pkg` instead.
- `Config#sign_rpm` prints a deprecation. If you specify an rpm signing passphrase, it is assumed you want to sign the package.
- `Config#rpm_signing_passphrase` prints a deprecation. You should specify the `signing_passphrase` inside `package :rpm` instead.
- Warn the user when invoking the `command` method in a `build` block that should be replaced with a top-level DSL method (like `command "rm -rf thing.rb"` should be replaced with `delete "thing.rb"`).

### Generator Changes
- The generator (`omnibus new NAME`) no longer generates assets (MSI, PKG, DMG, etc). If you need those assets, you can specify the `--thing-assets` (e.g. `--msi-assets`) flag.
- The generator does not render ERB files for assets - instead, it just generates the raw ERB files for your modification.
- Improve the comments in teh generated project Gemfile
- Put "development" gems in a `:development` group in the generated project Gemfile for easy exclusion with `bundle install --without development`.
- Update generated `<project>.rb` file to use new APIs
- Generate a "real" software example (zlib) that showcases many of the new APIs for learning.
- Always generate an `omnibus.rb` configuration file with "secret" values specified using `ENV`.
- Remove outdated and `-example.rb` software definitions.

### DSL Changes
#### Project
- Removed `Project#msi_parameters`. Please use the packager-specific DSL `parameters` method instead.
- Removed `Project#msi_parameters[:upgrade_code]`. You must specify the `upgrade_code` packager-specific DSL method instead.
- Removed `Project#package_name`. This value is now calculated by Omnibus and you cannot tune it.
- Removed `Project#install_path`. Please use `Project#install_dir` instead.
- Removed `Project#files_path`. Please use `Project#resources_path` instead.
- Added `Project#resources_path`. Previously called "files", any Omnibus assets, images, or files are now referred to as "resources". The default value is `resources/PROJECT_NAME`.
- Removed `Project#replaces`. Please use `Project#replace` and specify a single package. You can specify `Package#replace` multiple times in the same project.
- Added `Project#replace` for specifying which existing package this project replaces.
- Added `Project#default_root` that uses `/opt` on Unix and `C:/` on Windows for easy cross-platform path-setting.
- Added `Project#package` for customizing a specific packager. This is a sub-DSL that is evaluated on the OS-specific packager. This DSL method may be specified in a file multiple times.
- Added `Project#compress` for customizing a specific compressor. This is a sub-DSL that is evaluated on the given compressor. This DSL method may be specified in a file multiple times and Omnibus will select the "best" compressor for the given platform. For example, if both DMG and TGZ compressors are given, Omnibus will prefer DMG on OS X systems and fallback to TGZ on others.
- Changed `Project#package_user` to default to `root` when no value is given.
- Changed `Project#package_group` to default to `Ohai['root_group']` and then `root` when no value is given.
- Removed `Project#platform_version`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Project#platform_family`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Project#platform`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Project#machine`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Project#dependencies`. List each dependency using `dependency` instead.
- Added `Project#ohai` for quick access to Ohai data.

#### Software
- Removed `Software#override_version`. There is no replacement.
- Removed `Software#install_dir`. Please use `Software#install_path` instead.
- Removed `Software#platform_version`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Software#platform_family`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Software#platform`. Use `ohai` instead.
- Removed `Software#architecture`. Use `ohai` instead or Chef Sugar instead.
- Added `Software#ohai` for quick access to Ohai data.
- Changed `Software#downloaded_file` to `Software#project_file`.
- Removed `Software#source_dir`. You can use `Omnibus::Config.source_dir` instead, but if you need access to this method, it is probably a bug in Omnibus.
- Removed `Software#cache_dir`. You can use `Omnibus::Config.cache_dir` instead, but if you need access to this method, it is probably a bug in Omnibus.
- Removed `Software#config`. You can use `Omnibus::Config` instead.

#### Builder
- Added `Builder#make` for choosing the correct `make` binary on the system. When `gmake` is present, it is preferred. The use of this method also sets the `MAKE` environment variable for consistency. You should change all instances of `command "make ..."` to `make "..."` to ensure true cross-platform building.
- Added `Builder#windows_safe_path` for shelling out to the system with the correct path separators.
- Added `Buidler#workers` for delegation to the config option.
- Removed `Buidler#max_build_jobs` in favor of `Builder#workers`.
- Add an `Builder#appbundle` function to the builder DSL

#### Packagers
- Added `Packager::DEB#vendor` for specifying the package vendor.
- Added `Packager::DEB#license` for specifying the package license.
- Added `Packager::DEB#priority` for specifying the package priority.
- Added `Packager::DEB#section` for specifying the package section.
- Added `Packager::MSI#upgrade_code` for specifying an upgrade code. You must specify this attribute to make MSI packages.
- Added `Packager::MSI#parameters` for specifying arbitrary parameters to be read into the Wix XML.
- Added `Packager::MSI#wix_light_extension` for activating arbitrary Wix light extentions.
- Added `Packager::MSI#wix_candle_extension` for activating arbitrary Wix candle extentions.
- Added `Packager::PKG#identifer` for specifying the identifier of the the Mac OS X PKG. This value is still interpreted if one is not given. Note: the `Config.mac_pkg_identifier` is no longer honored.
- Added `Packager::PKG#signing_passphrase` for specifying the signing passphrase. If this value is given, it is assumed you want to sign the package. Note: the `Config.sign_rpm` and `Config.rpm_signing_passphrase` is no longer honored.
- Added `Packager::RPM#vendor` for specifying the package vendor.
- Added `Packager::RPM#license` for specifying the package license.
- Added `Packager::RPM#priority` for specifying the package priority.
- Added `Packager::RPM#category` for specifying the package category.

### Bugfixes

- Improved documentation for Building on OSX.
- Improved documentation for Building on Windows.
- Improved documentation for Building on RHEL.
- Improved documentation for the `Builder` DSL.
- Standardized license headers.

- Updated Chef version in generated `.kitchen.yml`.
- Switch to OpenSSL::Digest which is threadsafe on 2.1.2
- Ensure final `*.dmg` name matches actual `*.pkg` name.
- Replace dashes (`-`) with tildes (`~`) in DEB and RPM versions

- "Package" is now a public API
- Generate a real omnibus configuration file (no more `omnibus.rb.example`)
- Add a releaser for Artifactory
- Add additional information to package metdata (such as shasums)
- Remove uses of Omnibus.config and use the Config object directly
- Add the ability to define multiple `software_gems` in the config
- Add the ability to define `local_software_paths` in the config
- Add the ability to disable git caching in the config
- Omnibus.load_configuration now requires a file path
- Add new API for loading a project - `Project.load`
- Add new API for loading a software - `Software.load`
- Add publish APIs for dirtying the git cache
- Add test coverage for the "public" API
- Add validation to `source` in software DSL
- Add logging to the Packager class
- Add functional tests for builders
- Update generator templates to use the new APIs
- Upgrade to Ohai 7.2
- Improve YARDoc

### Deprecations
- Remove deprecated `Omnibus.configure` method
- Deprecate `Omnibus.config.value` in favor of `Config.value` instead
- Deprecate `Omnibus.project_root` in favor of `Config.project_root`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform` in favor of `Ohai['platform']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform_family` in favor of `Ohai['platform_family']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `platform_version` in favor of `Ohai['platform_version']`
- Deprecate [DSL] `build_dir` in favor of `Config.build_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `cache_dir` in favor of `Config.cache_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `source_dir` in favor of `Config.source_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `config` in favor of `Config` (capitalized)
- Deprecate `Ohai.value` in favor of `Ohai['value']`
- Deprecate `Project#install_path` in favor of `Project.install_dir`
- Deprecate [DSL] `install_path` in favor of `install_dir`
- Rename `Config.install_path_cache_dir` to `git_cache_dir`
- Fix a bug in the deprecations where a hardcoded output was used instead of a dynamic variable

### DSL Changes
- Add `with_embedded_path` to software
- Add `with_standard_compiler_flags` to software
- Add `package_scripts_path` to project
- Add builder DSL methods for `mkdir`, `touch`, `delete`, `copy`, `move`, `link`, and `sync`

### Bug fixes
- Fix a small typo in the project generator (come -> some)
- Update sample software definition for libpng to 1.5.18
- Improved logging output
- Include Chef Sugar in both software and project DSLs
- Documentation updates and typographical fixes
- Change the generated omnibus.rb to use a default homepage that includes the protocol
- Ensure that software fetched via the PathFetcher are cached correctly
- Downgrade FPM to ~> 0.4 - FPM 1.0.0+ uses FFI to attach to some libc functions. This fails on RHEL 5 & 6. As we don’t need a bleeding edge FPM the easiest fix is to just downgrade to the most recent pre-1.0.0 version.
- Always print backtraces when errors occur
- Do not sent ldd/otool to the same file - first steps in allowing parallel builds
- Only rescue `Omnibus::Error` when invoked through the CLI - this will allow other bugs to actually raise at the Ruby level
- Refactor the algorithm for git caching to take into account overrides and missing versions
- Remove nested git directories before incremental caching occurs
- Intelligently parse the project's homepage because Ruby's native URI implementation is buggy
- Fetch all software at the start of the build - this fixes a bug where a build would fail halfway through because of a tiny typo of GitHub outage. Now, all required software is downloaded **before** the build starts, lowering the feedback time for a failure due to networking issues
- Use the fetcher's `version_for_cache` method directly, falling back to `0.0.0` (and a warining) if no version is given
- Require `net/http`, `net/https`, and `net/ftp` in the base fetcher module
- Use -R, not -W1 on FreeBSD's compile flags
- Expand all paths relative to the project_root
- Unset all Ruby, Bundler, amd Gem-related environment variables before shelling out
- Various documentation fixes and updates

### Potentially breaking changes
- Merged `Package` and `Artifact` into the same class and updated API - this was considered an **internal** API so it is not a violation of semver
- Use a common class for Omnibus exceptions - if you were rescuing Omnibus::Error, you might be rescuing all exceptions now
- Use a cleanroom object when evaluating the DSL - prior to this release, Omnibus did not declare a public API. Project and software definitions had unrestricted access to the entire project.rb and software.rb methods respectively. This poses two problems - first, it makes it impossible to guarantee a public DSL API over a public (code) API. Second, it permits a developer to change the behavior of project.rb or software.rb accidentially, simply by defining a new method. The introducing of a cleanroom fixes both these bugs, however, it was impossible to know what was formerly considered a public API. Thus, it is possible that a previously-relied-on method is now unavaiable using the cleanroom. Please open an issue if you encounter such a case.
- Remove mixlib-config - if you were relying on mixlib-config as a transitive dependency, it is no longer available
- Remove the ability to use an overrides file - this was for internal use only and was never exposed as a public API. However, if you dug into the code and found it, it has now been removed. For BC purposes, the value still exists in the configuration object, but is essentially a no-op
- Move project loading from INFO to DEBUG
- Truncate platforms to short versions
- All paths are represented internally as Unix-style paths - previously Omnibus would try to intelligently build your paths differently on Windows for the purposes of shelling out to the system. This proved to be unmaintainable and makes Ruby very unhappy in most circumsatances. As such, we have exposed the `windows_safe_path` method in the Builder DSL that will convert a string to a "Windows-safe path". This is only needed when shelling out to the system.


v3.1.1 (May 20, 2014)
---------------------
- Update project generators to use new APIs. The old project generators created a project that issued deprecation warnings!
- Stream build output to the debug logger. Specifying `--log-level debug` now includes **all** the build output as if you had run the command manually.
- Deprecate the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` environment variable in favor of the command line flag. This is only a deprecation, but the `OMNIBUS_APPEND_TIMESTAMP` will be removed in the next major release.
- Fix a bug in `windows_safe_path` to always return a string
- Add a `Config.base_dir` configuration value for easy tuning
- Remove the use of `Omnibus.root` in `BuildVersion#initializer`. This removes the many deprecation warnings that print on each software load.
- Output the current command in debug output when shelling out
- Output the current environment in debug output when shelling out
- Change the information that is displayed at different log levels with respect to shelling out. In `warn` mode, Omnibus will only display warnings/deprecations; you will not see any build commands or output. In `info` mode, Omnibus will display the commands and environment that are being used; you will not see the output from the build (unless it fails). In `debug` mode, Omnibus will display the commands, environment, and output (livestream) from commands.


v3.1.0 (May 14, 2014)
-------------------------
### New Features
- `friendly_name` is added to project DSL to be able to configure the name on packagers.
- `resources_path` is added to project DSL to be able to specify project specific resource files for packagers.
- Add the ability to "sign" OSX packages
- Allow packagers to have project-specific resources
- MSI packager for windows
- Added helpers for generating platform-specific paths
- New build_version DSL
- All new CLI that uses LazyLoading and a much nicer interface (BC-compat)

v3.0.0 (March 27, 2014)
------------
### New Features

- **No more rake!** Software definitions are incrementally built and cached using git instead. Software dependency build has been rewritten to leverage git caching. This means compiled software definitions are cached, so future Omnibus project builds are much faster. However, this does introduce some potential breaking changes.

  - Project-level software dependencies are built **last**.
  - it is assumed that project-level software dependencies are most frequently changed, and thus Omnibus optimize for such a case.
  - If you have software definitions that hard code `always_build`, you will probably want to turn that off now.
  - Blank directories are not cached. If you would like a blank directory to be cached, add a `.gitkeep` file to the folder.
  - The build order is compiled in a different way, which might result in a different ordered-installation than previous versions of omnibus.
  - For an example of you you might need to update your project, please see [opscode/omnibus-software@02d06a](https://github.com/opscode/omnibus-software/commit/02d06a74c02340b592e1864e7ab843bc14fa352a)
