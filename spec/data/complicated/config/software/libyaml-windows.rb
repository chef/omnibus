# libyaml 0.1.5 fixes a security vulnerability to 0.1.4.
# Since the rubyinstaller.org doesn't release ruby when a dependency gets
# patched, we are manually patching the dependency until we get a new
# ruby release on windows.
# See: https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/issues/210
# This component should be removed when libyaml 0.1.5 ships with ruby builds
# of rubyinstaller.org
