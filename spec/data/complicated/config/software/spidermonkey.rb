# == Build Notes ==
# The spidermonkey build instructions are copied from here:
# http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installing_SpiderMonkey
#
# These instructions only seem to work with spidermonkey 1.8.0-rc1 and
# earlier. Since couchdb 1.1.1 is compatible with spidermonkey 1.8.5,
# we should eventually invest some time into getting that version built.
